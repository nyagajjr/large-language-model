# You are given the price of a stock for 
# n
# n days. Your task is figure out the highest profit you could have made 
# if you had bought the stock on one day and sold it on another day.

# Consider the following situation:

# Day	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7
# Price	3	7	5	1	4	6	2	3
# Here the highest profit is 6 â€“ 1 = 5, achieved by buying on day 3 and selling on day 5.
